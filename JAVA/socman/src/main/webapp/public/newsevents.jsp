		<p>City council handed out an early Christmas present Tuesday,
			announcing $19.8 million for a 129 unit project for subsidized rental
			housing. The site, located at 8111 Granville Ave. on its southern
			frontage, and 8080 Anderson Road to the north where the old KFC
			outlet was situated, is owned by the city. In addition to offering
			affordable rental housing units, it will house community amenity
			space. Five, non-profit societies will help develop the property.
			They include Atira Women's Resource Society, Coast Mental Health,
			S.U.C.C.E.S.S. Affordable Housing Society, Tikva Housing Society and
			Turning Point Housing Society. CMHA Pathways Clubhouse will also be a
			community service provider in the project. The new residences will
			include studios, one and three bedroom units and have basic rents
			that will not exceed $850 per month. According to the city, each of
			the nonprofit housing societies involved with the project will
			generate its own occupancy and resident management policies which
			will include tenant selection and eligibility requirements. "Given
			limited availability of other funding sources, subsidized housing is
			difficult to build and operate - innovative partnerships are required
			for projects to succeed," said Mayor Malcolm Brodie in a press
			release. Funding for the project comes from the city's Affordable
			Housing Reserve Fund which collects money from developers to provide
			residences to low income earners. Earlier this month, city council
			approved spending $11.7 million for the Kiwanis Towers on Minoru
			Boulevard across from Richmond Centre which will provide 296 units of
			affordable rental housing for seniors. Combined with the Granville
			Avenue development, it represents a step in the right direction to
			provide housing for those on low incomes. But much more needs to be
			done to meet the local demand for affordable housing, said De Whalen,
			an executive member of the Richmond Poverty Response Committee. "When
			you look at what affordable housing means - taking up about 30 per
			cent of your income - and you realize that many of the jobs in
			Richmond are in the lower paying service industries, many with no
			benefits, that leaves a lot of people in need of affordable housing,"
			Whalen said. "Plus, if you look a the local poverty rate at 20 per
			cent - that's one in five people - it can create pretty high demand."
			How high? Whalen estimated the actual need for affordable housing is
			in the 4,000 unit range in Richmond. "So, what has been provided so
			far is nowhere near what is required," she said. But in the past six
			years, the city has provided just over 1,100 units that fall into the
			affordable category. "Since the approval of the City's Affordable
			Housing Strategy in 2007, a total of at least 973 housing units have
			been secured in a variety of the strategy's affordable housing
			categories - 460 of these fall under the strategy's top priority
			category defined as subsidized rental housing for low income
			households," Brodie said.</p>
